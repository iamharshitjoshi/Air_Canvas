# Air_Canvas

In this project, the goal is to create an "Air Canvas" that allows users to draw images in the air simply by waving a colored marker, such as a marker attached to the tip of their finger, in front of a camera. The project utilizes computer vision techniques from OpenCV, a popular library for image processing and computer vision tasks, to achieve this functionality. While the preferred programming language for this project is Python due to its extensive libraries and user-friendly syntax, the core concepts can be adapted to other languages supported by OpenCV.

The combination of color detection and morphological operations allows the system to create a stable and clean "Air Canvas." As users move the colored marker in front of the camera, the system tracks its motion and draws on the virtual canvas accordingly.

This project offers a creative and interactive way to draw and visualize ideas, leveraging the power of computer vision and real-time image processing. It can be a fun and educational tool for exploring the possibilities of technology and art.
